/** \mainpage SCOREC graph-based partitioning interface

Welcome to the EnGPar documentation

If you are looking to use EnGPar for partitioning, then you can get started with agi::Ngraph
which is the structure that is needed to use the partitioning tools as well as engpar.h
for the partitioning APIs.

If you are partitioning an apf::Mesh then you can also look at agi::apfGraph which is an interface
from apf::Mesh and agi::Ngraph.
