Visit booth# 212 at [SC17](http://sc17.supercomputing.org/) to talk with myself (@cwsmith),
Gerret Diamond (@diamog), and other staff members from Rensselaer's
[Center for Computational for Innovations](http://cci.rpi.edu/).  Look for the big mesh!

A copy of the EnGPar [ScalA'17]
(http://www.csm.ornl.gov/srt/conferences/Scala/2017/) presentation is
