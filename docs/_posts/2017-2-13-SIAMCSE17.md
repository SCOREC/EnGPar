title: Load Balancing at SIAM CSE17
---

Our load balancing work ["Fast Dynamic Load Balancing Tools for Extreme Scale
Systems"](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=83237) will be presented at [SIAM
CSE17](http://www.siam.org/meetings/cse17/) on March 1st from 4:30-6:30 pm as part
of the [PP4 Poster Session](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?sessioncode=62156).

Also visit the March 2nd talk ["Demonstration of Unstructured Mesh Adaptation
for Ice Sheet Modeling Applications"](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=82627)
in [MS243](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=60830)
at 3:30 pm to learn about the integration of our unstructured mesh components,
including load balancing, with the Albany multi-physics framework to simulate
ice-sheet melting.
